# blutils

What is "Blutils"? Blutils is a set of coretutils meant for everyday use.
The name Blutils is a wordplay between the color "blue" and the word "utils".

This set of coretutils has a lot of work left to do, but check out the Implementation tracker down below to find out what utils are done!

# Building
For the moment there's no way to install or build this set of utils. There is a "build.py" script but it wont symlink anything, so really you're on your own if you want to install this.

When I feel that it is in an acceptable state I'll provide an installation method!
